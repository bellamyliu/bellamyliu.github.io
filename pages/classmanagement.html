		Teachers can use ClassDojo to easily manage their classroom. Good student behavior can be promoted by just a few simple clicks. For example, if a student is on task, you can reward them by tapping their name and giving them a point.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		Rewards can also be easily customized as well. The name of the award as well as the point value for each award can be changed at any time.
