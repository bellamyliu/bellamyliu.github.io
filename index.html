	<p>
	Most school teachers today are not proficient in technology, and thus, unaware of 

	and/or unable to use Class Dojo. ClassDojo is a web and mobile app that provides 

	the easiest way for teachers to improve their classroom management. The use of 

	this app will allow teachers to give students clear and positive encouragement, thus 

	being able to promote positive behavior and keeping tracking of negative behavior 

	in the classroom.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	The project will teach users to create a ClassDojo account, set up their classes in the

	web app, and implement ClassDojo in their classroom. Users will be able to use 

	ClassDojo to encourage students, track their participation, monitor their behavior, 

	and share student progress with parents electronically.
